## User Story:
`AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business`

## Overview
Using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL, I created an employee management system that can be run on the command line. The user may view and input departments, roles, and employees as well as update an employee's role.

## Usage and Demonstration

- Download through GitHub
- Open terminal and navigate to the employee-tracker directory
- Enter `npm init -y` into terminal to create a new .json file
- Enter `npm i` into terminal
- Install inquirer with `npm i`
- Install mysql12 with `npm i mysql12`
- Install console table with `npm i console.table`
- Navigate to the db folder
- Enter `mysql -u root -p` into terminal
- Enter your password
- Enter `source schema.sql` into terminal
- Enter `source seeds.sql` into terminal
- Enter `quit` into terminal
- Navigate back to the the employee_tracker folder
